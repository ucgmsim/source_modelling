Rupture Propagation Module

This module provides functions for computing likely rupture paths from
information about the distances between faults.

Functions:
    - shaw_dieterich_distance_model:
      Compute fault jump probabilities using the Shaw-Dieterich distance model.
    - prune_distance_graph: Prune the distance graph based on a cutoff value.
    - probability_graph:
      Convert a graph of distances between faults into a graph of jump
      probabilities using the Shaw-Dieterich model.
    - sample_rupture_propagation: Sample a rupture propagation tree from a set of sources.

Typing Aliases:
    - DistanceGraph: A graph representing distances between faults.
    - RuptureCausalityTree: A tree representing the causality of ruptures between faults.

def loop_erased_random_walk(
    graph: nx.DiGraph, root: str, hitting_set: set[str]
) -> list[str]:
    """Perform a loop-erased random walk on the graph.

    A loop-erased random walk is a random walk that does not repeat itelf.

    If a graph looks like

    A -- B
    | \/ |
    | /\ |
    D -- C

    Then a *walk* in this graph would be a sequence of nodes connected by edges that may repeat, for example:

    A -> B -> C -> A -> D

    The *loop-erased random walk* is the same walk, but with the loops erased:

    A -> D

    Notice that the loop A -> B -> C -> A has been erased.

    Obviously a walk could continue forever, but usually we have a set of nodes
    we're interested in reaching, a so-called *hitting set*. For example if the
    hitting set in the above walk was C we would stopped at:

    A -> B -> C

    Of course, this walk has no loops, so this is what would be returned.

    A *loop-erased random walk* is a random walk that is then loop-erased. The
    walk randomly traverses the graph according to the weights of the edges, and
    then the loops are erased. The walk continues until it reaches a node in the
    `hitting_set`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    graph : nx.DiGraph
        The graph to perform the walk on.
    root : str
        The starting node of the walk.
    hitting_set : set[str]
        The set of nodes that the loop erased walk must end at.

    Returns
    -------
    list[str]
        A loop-erased random walk beginning at `root` that hits the `hitting_set`.
